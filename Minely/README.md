# Welcome to Minely
## A project as a demo for my IS601 Spring 2020 class to use as reference
##### Build a mining empire! Buy land lots, hire workers, and gather various resources and become the most successful!
[Original Project Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A9VVx-3nTT_jgayArqnIGfpveInO3NATv3FmbP_vPUU/edit "Google Doc Link")
- [x] User can register a new account with a unique email address
- [x] User can login with a valid email address and password
- [x] User passwords should not be stored in plain text
- [x] User can logout; their session should be destroyed and the only way back in should be login page
- [x] User will be able to acquire land lot
    - [x] Given 1 at start (not given, but first costs zero)
- [x] Purchase extra lots as the game progresses
- [x] Starting price will be x “coins” and will be multiplied by 1.5? for each future land lot
    - Followed a bit different algorithm (To Be Updated)
- [x] Land lot will get a random set of resource producers
    - [x] Trees
        - [x] Various types to produce different qualities of wood
    - [x] Mineral Deposits
        - [x] Various types to produce different ore
    - [x] Resource producers deplete after x material has been gathered
    - [x] User can spend “coin” to survey the land lot of another random resource
- [x] User will be able to hire workers
- [x] Workers can work any job type
- [x] Workers will have potentially unique stats
    - [x] Name [thanks to names](https://pypi.org/project/names/)
    - [x] Sprite? Just using basis css (I'm not an artist `````¯\_(ツ)_/¯````` )
    - [x] Cooldown time
    - [x] Efficiency (# of items from “gathering” activity)
        - mix of skill and efficiency
    - [x] Health
    - [x] (added) learning rate to determine how quickly to gain proficiency
    - [x] (added) proficiency for each job type that increases with use
- [ ] There will be 3 job types
    - [x] Woodcutter
        - [x] Cuts trees (just gathers resource, no special distinction)
    - [x] Miner
        - [x] Mines ore (just gathers resource, no special distinction)
    - [ ] Smelter
        - [ ] Smelts ore to Ingots
- [ ] User will be able to use resources to build tools
    - [ ] Types (from wood and Ingots)
    - [ ] Axes
    - [ ] Pickaxes
    - [ ] Smelter’s Kit
    - [ ] Tools will increase job efficiency
    - [ ] Tools degrade with use
    - [ ] Durability is random per material type (i.e., [basic wood] Random(1,10))
- [ ] User will be able to trade workers
    - They can offer them a better job (which puts them on the market and player receives a commission (kind of like a headhunter))
    - [ ] Implement actual trading system so resources can be part of the deal
- [ ] User will be able to trade resources
- [ ] Trades will have a “coin” fee when listing regardless of successful trade/sale
- [ ] Trades can be any of the following
    - [ ] resources to coins
    - [ ] coins to resources
    - [ ] resources to resources
- [ ] There will be public scoreboards based on the following
    - [ ] Weekly
        - [ ] Most gold generated this week
        - [ ] Most resource X generated this week (x will be for each resource type)
        - [ ] Top 3 will be awarded “coins”
    - [ ] All-time
        - [ ] Gold generation
        - [ ] Combined resource generation
### Reach Goals
- [ ] Natural disasters will occur to affect resources
- [ ] Natural disasters will occur to affect workers
- [ ] Workers can be healed via food
    - [ ] Only purchasable from “shop”
